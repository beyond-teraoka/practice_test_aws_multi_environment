# Practice Test: AWS Multi Environment

## Outline
- This is a practical exam for building an infrastracture which have multiple environments.
- Please build a specific diagram based on the architecture diagram through AWS.
- The task has four phases which ensure that each phase is built correctly.
ã€€
## Notes
- Please use the login information carefully when logging in to the Management Console in AWS.
- Please stop running EC2 and RDS when you're not using them.
